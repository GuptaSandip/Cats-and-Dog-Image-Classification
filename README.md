# Cats-and-Dog-Image-Classification
The objective of the Cat and Dog Classification project is to develop a Deep learning model that accurately classifies images of cats and dogs into their respective categories.

This project aims to:

Enhance Image Recognition Skills: Utilize deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to improve the accuracy of image classification tasks.

- Data Preprocessing: Implement effective data preprocessing techniques, including image normalization, resizing, and augmentation, to enhance model performance and robustness.

- Model Development: Design, train, and evaluate a CNN architecture capable of distinguishing between cat and dog images with high accuracy.

- Performance Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, while also analyzing confusion matrices for deeper insights into misclassifications.

- Real-World Application: Demonstrate the potential of the classification model for real-world applications, such as pet adoption services, animal welfare organizations, and automated image sorting systems.

By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to contribute to advancements in image classification technologies and provide a foundational understanding of deep learning methodologies.
